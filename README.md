## Description

**Themis** is a decentralized, federated discussion network based on the [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/) standard.

## Goal

The goal of Themis is to create a platform for discussion, debate, and communication using a topic-centered model. Rather than the ephemeral messaging of Twitter, Mastodon, etc., we believe that this style, derived from message boards, web forums, and Usenet, can foster a healthier sort of conversation.

## Installation and Usage

*TODO* (I'll fill this in once there's actual code. Same for Contributing and other sections.)

## License

  Themis is free open source software under the [MIT licensed](LICENSE).
